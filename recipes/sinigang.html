        <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
        <p>Sinigang is a Filipino soup cooked with pork. Serve with rice and for additional sauce, use soy or fish sauce. If you want to, you can add what Filipinos call gabi gabi, which is a small taro root. When peeled they look like potatoes. You can add five to six of them when you add the water and make sure they are cooked through. Take them out when they are cooked because they can get too soft.</p>
        <p>If a survey regarding the Philippines’ national food was conducted, then sinigang would certainly be ranked in one of the top spots. Both recipes represent the Filipino culture and many consider these dishes as staples in the traditional family gathering.</p>

        <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, chopped</li>
            <li>2 plum tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
            <li>1 pound bone-in pork chops</li>
            <li>4 cups water, more if needed</li>
            <li>1 (1.41 ounce) package tamarind soup base (such as Knorr®)</li>
            <li>½ pound fresh green beans, trimmed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
        <ol>
