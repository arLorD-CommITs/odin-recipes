Hi! This is my very first GitHub repo!

I aim to demonstrate my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills that I've learned thus far.
Including but not limited to, unordered/ordered lists, descriptive lists, CSS stylings, basic DOM manipulation in javascript and HTML5 Boiler plate!

These are the only ones I can come up with out of the top of my head. But I'll make sure to add and try more things as I go along.

Never Give Up! Keep going forward and pierce the Heavens!
